Making an image classifier using tensor flow for poets

Classifier used: Neural Network.
Tensorflow for Poets sets up and trains the neural network behind the scenes.


Ubuntu 16.04

1.  Download the Anaconda
	 - It is a python distribution, with installation and package management tools.
	 - It provides large selection of packages and commercial support. It is an environment 	   manager, which provides the facility to create different python environments, each with 		   their own settings.
	 - Anaconda is a set of python libraries which has the standard python programming 		   language libraries as well as numerous third party scipy libraries like numpy, pandas, 		   scikit-learn.
	Conda
	 - “Conda”, the Anaconda’s own package manager, is used for updating anaconda and its      		    packages.
	 - Conda is a cross platform package and environment manager. It provides installing, 		   executing and updating different packages along with their dependencies.

Command : bash Anaconda-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh

2. Check if spyder is installed. If not, install it.
	- spyder is an open source cross-platform integrated 		  development environment (IDE) for scientific programming in 		  the Python language. 
	- Spyder integrates NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib and IPython, as 		  well as other open source software.

Command: spyder

3. Command : pip list 

	lists all the installed libraries in the system

4. Check if conda is present :

Command: conda --version

5. Check if python is present. if not, install it

Command : python --version

6. Install Tensorflow 

Useful Link: https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_linux

As told in the article ;

In Anaconda, you may use conda to create a virtual environment. However, within Anaconda, we recommend installing TensorFlow with the pip install command, not with the conda install command.

a) Create a conda environment named tensorflow to run a version of Python by invoking the following command:

Command: conda create -n tensorflow pip python=2.7

b) Activate the conda environment by issuing the following command:

Command: source activate tensorflow
 (tensorflow)$  # Your prompt should change 

c) Issue a command of the following format to install TensorFlow inside your conda environment:

Command: pip install --ignore-installed --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/linux/cpu/tensorflow-1.6.0-cp27-none-linux_x86_64.whl

7. Run python

Command: python

Pay special attention to - (4) Re-training the network

8. git clone https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tensorflow-for-poets-2

9. ls

LIAM: CHANGE DIRECTORY TO tensorflow

10. cd tensorflow

11. a folder will be formed named tf_files. Within this file add the file named ASL-Alphabets

12. ls tf_files/media
	It should display - 1, 2, .. 10, A, B.. Y

13. IMAGE_SIZE=224

14. ARCHITECTURE="mobilenet_0.50_${IMAGE_SIZE}"

15. tensorboard --logdir tf_files/training_summaries &

16. python3 -m scripts.retrain -h

17. python3 -m scripts.retrain   
    --bottleneck_dir=tf_files/bottlenecks   
    --how_many_training_steps=500   
    --model_dir=tf_files/models/   
    --summaries_dir=tf_files/training_summaries/"${ARCHITECTURE}" 
    --output_graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb   
    --output_labels=tf_files/retrained_labels.txt   
    --architecture="${ARCHITECTURE}"   
    --image_dir=tf_files/media

python3 -m scripts.retrain --bottleneck_dir=tf_files/bottlenecks --how_many_training_steps=500 --model_dir=tf_files/models/ --summaries_dir=tf_files/training_summaries/"${ARCHITECTURE}" --output_graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb --output_labels=tf_files/retrained_labels.txt --architecture="${ARCHITECTURE}" --image_dir=tf_files/media

18. python3 -m  scripts.label_image -h


TESTING

19. python3 -m scripts.label_image --graph=tf_files/retrained_graph.pb --image=yyy/input.jpg


TERMINATE PORT 8000:

sudo fuser -k 8000/tcp
